    <h1>About the Newton-Raphson Method</h1>
    <section>
      <p>
        The Newton-Raphson method is an iterative numerical technique used to find approximate roots of real-valued functions. It is based on the idea of using tangents to approximate the function and refine guesses for the root.
      </p>
      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <p>
        Given a function \(f(x)\) and its derivative \(f'(x)\), the method starts with an initial guess \(x_0\). The next approximation \(x_{n+1}\) is calculated using the formula:
      </p>
      <p>
        \[
        x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}
        \]
      </p>
      <p>
        This process is repeated until the difference between successive approximations is less than a specified tolerance level \(ε\), or until a maximum number of iterations is reached.
